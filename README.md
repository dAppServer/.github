# dAppServer Prototype

Here lies a prototype of a typescript based client side eco system for PWA's, I've made all the component parts, some hidden in git history.

Taking this to production ready, i need another two developers who want to work on this a couple times a week.

It's a very large job, so, watch this space or email me on snider@lethean.io and i can walk through the websocket terminal, object store, app store, encryption and accounts system.
