# dAppServer Prototype

Here is a prototype of a typescript-based client-side ecosystem for PWAs; I've made all the parts, some of which are hidden in the git history.

Taking this to production ready, i need another two developers who want to work on this a couple times a week.

It's a tremendous job, so watch this space or email me at snider@lethean.io. I can walk you through the WebSocket terminal, object store, app store, encryption, and accounts system.

I've been programming since 2002; any skill level is acceptable. I can help you learn, so don't worry if you are new, I've got you.
